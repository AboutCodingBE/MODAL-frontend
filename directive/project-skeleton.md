# Building the skeleton

reference: https://datable.be/MODAL/wireframe3.html

- Build an archivebrowser component. This component will show the created archives as a list of 'cards'. The archive browser has a create
button with text: 'nieuw archief'. 
- Clicking the button 'nieuw archief' opens the modal window as shown in the `crate-archive-modal.png` picture. When pressing the 'select folder' button, 
a folder explorer should open so that a user can pick a folder. This should already work. The picked folder is then 'entered' as the value in the 
input next to the 'select folder' button. 
- The button 'annuleren' should just close the modal without any impact
- The button 'archief ingesten' should do nothing yet
- No other components should be created so far
- The routing to the archive browser whould work
- The language of the interface is Dutch.
